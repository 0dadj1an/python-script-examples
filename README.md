# python script examples

This repository contains my python script examples, which are explained in more detail at the [Coding Networker Blog](https://codingnetworker.com).

The following examples are included in this repository:

* [Parse CLI outputs with TextFSM](https://codingnetworker.com/2015/08/parse-cli-outputs-textfsm/) - This post describes how to parse CLI outputs using TextFSM. Within the an example, I work with multiple "show inventory" commands from a Cisco IOS device in a single text file.
* [Configuration generator with python and Jinja2](https://codingnetworker.com/2015/09/configuration-generator-with-python-and-jinja2/) - This post describes, how to build a simple configuration generator using python and Jinja2. I'll explain it using CSV and JSON based parameter files.
* [Cisco NX-API on Nexus 5500](https://codingnetworker.com/2015/09/cisco-nx-api-nexus-5500/) - This post gives you a short introduction to the Cisco NX-API on Nexus 5500 with NX-OS 7.2
* [Custom filters for a Jinja2 based config generator](https://codingnetworker.com/2015/10/custom-filters-jinja2-config-generator/) - In this post, I'll explain how to include custom filters in Jinja2 and how to use them within the configuration templates
* [Implement HSRP using ciscoconfparse](https://codingnetworker.com/2015/10/implement-hsrp-using-ciscoconfparse/) - This post describes an example to create a configuration for HSRP based on an existing Cisco IOS configuration using the ciscoconfparse module

In the post [about Vagrant](https://codingnetworker.com/2015/09/use-vagrant-to-run-the-python-examples/) you can find a description how to execute the examples without affecting your current environment.
